# IMPORTANT NOTE: prefixed linking of wasmtime requires changing the generated
# file to specify `rust_static_library` instead of `rust_library`. The
# following sed command will do it for you:
#
# `sed -i.bak -e 's/rust_library/rust_static_library/g' bazel/cargo/wasmtime/remote/BUILD.wasmtime-c-api-impl-*.bazel`
